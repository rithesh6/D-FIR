# D-FIR
Decentralised FIR lodging

This project stores the FIR data on the blockchain network nowadays we see many police personnel doing some fraud with the databases containing FIR's and manipulating it for their own good and sometimes the FIR reports are even modified when someone bribes the Police staff so that they can modify the previously existing data so to keep all the data secure and transparent we have created a whole Fir lodging on the blockchain network where it can be kept safe and it cannot be manipulated once implemented.
